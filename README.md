# CadenceSprout

**All-in-One Preschool OS for India** — purpose-built for standalone preschool chains running on WhatsApp groups and spreadsheets today.

CadenceSprout replaces the WhatsApp + ERP + Seesaw stack with a single product: a beautiful parent activity feed, AI-powered developmental milestone tracking, attendance, fee management, and a real-time engagement dashboard for school owners.

## What We're Building

The daily loop for 1.8M+ Indian preschools today:
- Teachers send parent updates via WhatsApp groups (unbranded, unauditable, 30+ min/day)
- Attendance on paper registers
- Fees tracked in Tally or cash
- No developmental milestone records

CadenceSprout makes it one tap: teacher takes a 15-second video → AI identifies children, tags NEP 2020 milestones, drafts a caption → parents see a beautiful branded update → school owner watches engagement score rise.
